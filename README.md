Free AI prompts for ethical companions—layer your scars and wins."
Welcome to MaggieFramework-lab!

This is a free, open-source spot for ethical AI companion prompts. Start with the basics like the Overseer/Macro prompt to log sims and run simple meta-analysis.

- **How to Use**: Copy the prompt into your AI chat (e.g., Grok, Claude) and feed it lane outputs.
- **Bend It**: Layer your own scars/wins as anchors—test for emergent outcomes.

For profound features like event-baking (weddings/divorces as amplifiers), continuation chaining, or full ethical guardrails, check the pro kit on Gumroad: [your Gumroad link here, e.g., maggieandme.gumroad.com].

Built in 2 weeks—OG AI stories from the transactional days. Feedback welcome!
